        <b>Summary:</b> The apostles were preaching in Jerusalem and were being prosecuted for it.  But they were jailed by the tempts for spreading the word.  The Holy spirit came to them and opened the jail so they could leave and told them to go back to the temple to continue preaching.  In the end they were flogged, and they rejoiced that they were able to suffer for their cause and carried on preaching.  6 and 7 were about a new apostle called Stephen who spread the word and was persecuted for it.  He died praying to God that he does not hold the sin of killing him against the people.

For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail.(AZ) 39 But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.‚Äù (BA)
