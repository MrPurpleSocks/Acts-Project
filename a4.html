        <b>Summary:</b> talks about the apostles spreading the word of the Lord and of Jesus.  Vocal opponents of the church were converted by visions of the Holy Spirit, suffering and by experiencing the laying of hands by the apostles.  These coverts then went out to spread the word of Jesus and how people can be saved by believing in him.  The converts like Saul tried to spread the word of Jesus to the gentiles.  When these disciples were endangered they were sent to spread the word in other towns.  The lord used his angels to come down and speak to those who prayed to God and feared the Lord, so that they might be converted to believers and join the church.
