        <h1 class="title"><b>Acts 1</b></h1>
        <p><b>Characters:</b> God, Jesus, Luke, Theophilus, John the Baptist, Judas, Joseph, Matthias, Mary, Peter, David, disciples
        
        <b>Summary:</b> Jesus provided many proofs that he was still alive. Jesus instructed his disciples to stay in Jerusalem and wait for a gift from God. He also promised that one day Jesus will come back to earth. Judas helped the guards arrest Jesus, so the disciples had to choose another person to take Judasâ€™ place of leadership. They wanted someone who had been with Jesus the whole time. They chose Joseph and Matthias.
        
        <b>Verses:</b>
        <b>Acts 1:3</b> "He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God."
	    <b>Acts 1:11</b> "This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven."
