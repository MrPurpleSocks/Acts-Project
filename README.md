# Acts-Project
My project will be a webpage with text describing Acts. I plan to use some of my own photos todisplay God's creatoins and events from Acts.

It's Up! Visit it at patphotog.com . Note: You will be warned that there's no security... That's true, I'm cheap. But there isn't really a reason for it right now.

# Update
Due to time constraints, i'm going to be combining chapters into sets of three. Chapter 1 will stay the same.
TBH this repository is going to get much bigger with at least 20 HTML and CSS file being uploaded. Also, the website doesn't have the current code, CPanel sucks for uploading, so i'm waiting a bit before I upload it.
