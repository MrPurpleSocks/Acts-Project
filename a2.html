        <b>Summary:</b> On the day of the Pentecost, tongues of fire came down, and started saying the wonders of God to everyone. Even though they were saying the same thing, every one understood them. Peter healed a lame man. Peter than talked about how the people should not be surprised that God had done this for the lame man. Peter an John where then put on trial for disturbing the sermon. They were than released with many warnings. After this, the believers shared their many possessions.

        <b>Verses:</b> <br>
        <b>Acts 4:8-12</b> “Rulers and elders of the people! 9 If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed,10 then know this, you and all      the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. 11 Jesus is
                “‘the stone you builders rejected,
                which has become the cornerstone.’[a]
            12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.
